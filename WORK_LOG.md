| 1/27 |  9:05 - 9:35am  |                                                                                                                              I brainstormed new ideas alongside my classmates and wrote basic pseudocode for each idea. |
| 1/27 |  9:35 - 9:55am  |                                                                                                                                                                       I continued brainstorming and writing pseudocode. |
| 1/28 |  2:05 - 2:30pm  | I thought through the problem set more post-hint and started working on the recursive method. I haven't yet decided how I should check for the number of ways when recursing through each target value/number of coins. |

| 2/1  | 11:30 - 11:50pm |                                                                                                                                                    I continued thinking through base cases for the recursive algorithm. |
