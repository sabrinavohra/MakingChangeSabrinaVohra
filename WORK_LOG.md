| 1/26 | 12:25 - 12:55pm |                                                                                                                                         I began thinking through the project and writing pseudocode for my primary idea. |
| 1/27 |  9:05 - 9:35am  |                                                                                                                               I brainstormed new ideas alongside my classmates and wrote basic pseudocode for each idea. |
| 1/27 |  9:35 - 9:55am  |                                                                                                                                                                        I continued brainstorming and writing pseudocode. |
| 1/28 |  2:05 - 2:30pm  |  I thought through the problem set more post-hint and started working on the recursive method. I haven't yet decided how I should check for the number of ways when recursing through each target value/number of coins. |
| 2/1  | 11:00 - 11:30pm |                                                                                                                         I continued working through the code using my pseudocode and recursive ideas to find base cases. |
| 2/1  | 11:30 - 11:50pm |                                                                                                                                                     I continued thinking through base cases for the recursive algorithm. |
| 2/3  | 10:45 - 11:15am |                                                                                                                                                                       We looked on the slides and brainstormed in class. |
| 2/6  |  2:45 - 3:00pm  |                                                             I started working through the process on the slides for memoization. I am getting an out of bounds error and think I am not properly checking the 2-d array. |
| 2/10 | 12:50 - 1:20pm  | I figured out the memoization solution by figuring out that I had to increase the number of rows in my storage table, with Mr. Blick's help. I began working on tabulation by solving a similar way but going bottom up. |
| 2/12 |  9:35 - 9:50am  |                                                                                                                              I worked on the tabulation approach by trying to use a for-loop to update the array values. |
| 2/13 |  1:50 - 2:00pm  |                            I worked on my tabulation approach, and realized I was calling the wrong target when I call the method in  my main method. This fixed the problems I was having and made my solution correct. |


To add a new row to the table, click into a cell and then hit shift-enter.
